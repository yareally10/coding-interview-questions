This repo contains a series of coding interview questions I solved over a few months. 
Some of them are real interview questions I encountered during technical interviews,
some are practice ones I found online. I decided to publish these solutions so I could
keep track of what I did, and hopefully also could help others in their interview process.

I chose to solve these questions using JavaScript because it is widely used by many
people/organizations, and also sharpen my JS skill. If you see an incorrect solution,
or a solution that could be optimized, please submit a pull request.
